Hash: SHA256

DarkDotFail has regained control of the domain "dark.fail", the
Twitter account "@DarkDotFail", the Reddit account "/u/DarkDotfail",
and the email address "hello@dark.fail". Thank you Njalla for your
tireless work in getting our hijacked domain back. The attacker was
unable to get past 2FA on our Twitter, Reddit, and Email. They did
not access any messages nor servers. Our OPSEC is fully intact.

A phisher stole our domain and operated it for four days in a highly
sophisticated attack that bypassed all security protocols we had in
place, including 2FA. The attacker sent a fake German court order to
Njalla's partner Tucows and convinced them to transfer our domain to 
Namecheap. They then listed 68 phishing replicas of real sites on
our domain, stealing an untold amount of cryptocurrency from these
sites' researchers and users. They also hijacked DarknetLive.com.

It took Namecheap four days to transfer our domain back to us.

Read @brokep's summary of what happened for more information: 
https://twitter.com/brokep/status/1389314362561777665

Every site listed on the domain "dark.fail" from April 29th through
May 4th 2021 was a man-in-the-middle phishing proxy. Each site
looked real but instead shared all user activity with the attacker,
including passwords and messages. Cryptocurrency addresses displayed
on these sites were rewritten to addresses controlled by the phisher,
intercepting many people's money.

If you used links from the domain "dark.fail" between April 29th
through May 4th you were phished and should rotate all passwords.

DarkDotFail's .onion address was not affected by this attack. No
phishing sites have ever been displayed there.

As long as we are maintain a clearnet mirror, we cannot fully promise that
this will not happen again. The domain name system is centralized and prone
to human error and deceit.

Always check /mirrors.txt and PGP verify it. Researchers that PGP verified
sites before interacting with them during this attack outsmarted the phish.

This unprecedented attack has set back our entire community. We are
implementing ways to rely less on the antiquated domain name system
used by the clearnet and to move to decentralized DNS alternatives.

We are infuriated that our trusted name was used for harm.

Devastated, motivated. Big changes are on their way.

DarkDotFail
