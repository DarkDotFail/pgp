EMERGENCY: DO NOT TRUST THE DOMAIN 'dark.fail' RIGHT NOW! My domain name was hijacked by a phisher. Darknetlive is also hijacked. Do NOT trust links on dark.fail or darknetlive until we regain control! Install Tor Browser and use "darkfailllnkf4vf.onion" to access my site. Always verify PGP /mirrors.txt!

My .onion I am in full control of. I am in control of all of my servers and all of my keys.

It appears a phisher transferred our domains from Nja.la to Namecheap without my permission despite 2FA being enabled on Nja.la. If your registrar is Nja.la be very careful right now.

I urgently need the community's help in contacting Namecheap and Nja.la to give me back control of my domain.

Do not send any emails to "hello@dark.fail" until further notice. Do not trust any links on my clearnet site. I am working to regain access to my Twitter.

Only contact me using these methods:

Email: darkdotfail_alternate@protonmail.com
Jabber: darkdotfail@jabber.calyxinstitute.org

Attacks like this underscore the importance of my site's existence in the first place.

Researchers, journalists, activists, be safe.

I am working tirelessly to restore clearnet service.

Sorry for the disruption in service and trust.
DarkDotFail
