EMERGENCY: DO NOT TRUST THE DOMAIN 'dark.fail' RIGHT NOW! My domain name was hijacked by a phisher. Darknetlive is also hijacked. Do NOT trust links on dark.fail or darknetlive until we regain control! Install Tor Browser and use "darkfailllnkf4vf.onion" to access my site. Always verify PGP /mirrors.txt!

My .onion I am in full control of. I am in control of all of my servers and all of my keys.

It appears a phisher transferred our domains from Njal.la to Namecheap without my permission despite 2FA being enabled on Njal.la. If your registrar is Njal.la be very careful right now. They sent me no emails throughout this process.

I urgently need the community's help in contacting Namecheap and Njal.la to give me back control of my domain.

Do not send any emails to "hello@dark.fail" until further notice. Do not trust any links on my clearnet site. I am working to regain access to my Twitter.

Only contact me using these methods:

Email: darkdotfail_alternate@protonmail.com
Jabber: darkdotfail@jabber.calyxinstitute.org

Attacks like this underscore the importance of my site's existence in the first place.

Researchers, journalists, activists, be safe.

I am working tirelessly to restore clearnet service.

Sorry for the disruption in service and trust.
DarkDotFail
